Project: Automated Incident Response and Remediation System (

Objective:

This project builds on the basic monitoring system and introduces:

1) Log analysis and categorization
2)  ServiceNow integration for incident management
3)  MySQL database for tracking incidents
4)  Ansible automation for remediation
5) Git for version control
 
Real-Time Use Case Scenario:
A company wants to automate incident detection and response based on system logs. The system should:
Monitor server health and logs.
Analyze logs for predefined error patterns.
Categorize incidents based on known error messages.
Log incidents in MySQL and create ServiceNow tickets.
Trigger Ansible playbooks to resolve common issues.
Track issue resolution and notify admins.

User Stories for Automated Incident Response and Remediation System

User Story 1: System Monitoring (Linux & Shell Scripting)
Title: Monitor system resources and detect anomalies

As a system administrator
I want to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
So that I can detect high resource usage and prevent system failures
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ A script runs every 5 minutes to check CPU, disk, and memory usage
✅ If thresholds exceed defined limits, an alert is generated
✅ The script triggers log analysis for further investigation

User Story 2: Log Analysis and Incident Categorization (Python & Regex)
Title: Analyze system logs for error patterns

As a support engineer
I want to analyze logs and categorize issues based on known patterns
So that I can quickly identify and classify incidents
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ The system reads the last 10 log entries from /var/log/syslog
✅ Predefined error patterns (e.g., "disk full", "out of memory") are matched using regular expressions
✅ If a match is found, the issue is categorized accordingly

User Story 3: Incident Logging in MySQL
Title: Store incidents in a database

As a database administrator
I want to log detected incidents in a structured database
So that I can track recurring issues and generate reports
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ A MySQL database stores logs, issue categories, and timestamps
✅ Each new incident is added to the database
✅ A history of past incidents can be queried for analysis

User Story 4: ServiceNow Integration
Title: Create an incident in ServiceNow

As a IT support engineer
I want to automatically generate an incident ticket in ServiceNow
So that IT teams are notified of system issues
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ When an issue is detected, an API request is sent to ServiceNow
✅ The ticket includes details like CPU usage, disk space, memory, and logs
✅ The incident appears in the ServiceNow dashboard with the correct priority and category

User Story 5: Automated Remediation using Ansible
Title: Automatically resolve common incidents

As a system administrator
I want to trigger Ansible playbooks to fix common issues
So that the system can recover without manual intervention
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ If an issue matches a known problem, an appropriate Ansible playbook is triggered
✅ Playbooks can restart services, clear log files, or free up memory
✅ Logs confirm that remediation actions were executed successfully

User Story 6: Scheduled Execution (Cron Jobs)
Title: Automate monitoring and remediation with scheduled jobs

As a DevOps engineer
I want to schedule system monitoring and remediation tasks
So that they run automatically without manual execution
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ A cron job runs the monitoring script every 5 minutes
✅ A cron job triggers the Ansible playbook when issues are detected
✅ Logs confirm that scheduled jobs executed as expected

User Story 7: Version Control with Git
Title: Maintain project versions using Git

As a developer
I want to track changes to scripts and configurations using Git
So that I can roll back to previous versions if needed
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ All scripts and playbooks are stored in a Git repository
✅ Developers can commit, push, and pull changes
✅ A history of changes is available for debugging and collaboration

Bonus: User Story 8 - Notification System (Optional Enhancement)
Title: Send email/SMS notifications for critical incidents

As a IT manager
I want to receive notifications when high-priority incidents occur
So that I can take immediate action if necessary
Acceptance Criteria:
✅ If a critical incident is detected, an email or SMS notification is sent
✅ Notifications include the issue description and a link to the ServiceNow ticket
✅ The notification system can be enabled or disabled via configuration
