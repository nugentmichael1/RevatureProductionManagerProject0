Yes! If you want to query the Prometheus server itself using **PromQL**, you can use built-in **metrics exposed by Prometheus** to monitor its own performance, targets, and scrape status.

### Common PromQL Expressions for Monitoring Prometheus Itself

#### **1. Check Targets & Scrape Status**
- **Check the number of active targets being scraped:**
  ```promql
  count(up)
  ```
  - Returns the number of targets currently **up**.

- **Check the status of a specific target (replace `<job_name>` with the actual job name):**
  ```promql
  up{job="<job_name>"}
  ```
  - Returns `1` if the target is up, `0` if it's down.

- **Check last scrape duration for each target:**
  ```promql
  scrape_duration_seconds
  ```
  - Helps identify slow targets.

- **Check last scrape timestamp for each target:**
  ```promql
  scrape_timestamp_seconds
  ```
  - Helps ensure targets are being scraped on time.

#### **2. Prometheus Server Metrics**
- **Total number of scrapes performed:**
  ```promql
  prometheus_target_scrapes_total
  ```

- **Scrape failures (should be `0` ideally):**
  ```promql
  prometheus_target_scrape_pool_exceeded_failures_total
  ```

- **Total number of time series stored:**
  ```promql
  prometheus_tsdb_head_series
  ```

- **Memory usage of Prometheus:**
  ```promql
  process_resident_memory_bytes
  ```
  - Tracks Prometheus RAM consumption.

- **CPU usage of Prometheus:**
  ```promql
  process_cpu_seconds_total
  ```
  - Monitors how much CPU time Prometheus is consuming.

#### **3. Storage & Retention**
- **Current TSDB (Time Series Database) storage size:**
  ```promql
  prometheus_tsdb_storage_blocks_bytes
  ```

- **Oldest stored timestamp (in seconds since Unix epoch):**
  ```promql
  prometheus_tsdb_lowest_timestamp_seconds
  ```

- **Current WAL (Write-Ahead Log) size:**
  ```promql
  prometheus_tsdb_wal_size_bytes
  ```

#### **4. Query Performance**
- **Number of active queries running:**
  ```promql
  prometheus_engine_queries
  ```

- **Slow queries (longer than 5 seconds):**
  ```promql
  rate(prometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds_bucket{le="5"}[5m])
  ```

#### **5. Alerts & Rules**
- **Number of active alerts:**
  ```promql
  count(ALERTS)
  ```

- **Check alert rule evaluation duration:**
  ```promql
  rate(prometheus_rule_group_duration_seconds[5m])
  ```
